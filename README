Continuity: Tools for working with Macromedia Director movies.

This is primarily a GUI viewer tool to assist with our implementation of a
full runtime (someday). It requires Python 2.x and PySide.

At present this handles versions up to v3: you can feed it a Mac resource
fork or an MMM file (from the Gaffer). Usage: 'python viewer.py filename'.

This is all licensed under GPLv2. Thanks to Screwtape (Tim Allen) for the
original resource fork code.
